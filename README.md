# Task Management Tool

A REST API for team task management — the backend behind something like Linear, Jira, or Trello.

Multi-tenant organizations, teams, projects, and tasks with role-based authorization, JWT session auth with refresh token rotation, and Redis for rate limiting and session state.

> **Status: in progress.** Authentication is complete and hardened. The relational schema is designed and migrated. Endpoints for organizations, teams, projects, and tasks are the current work. See [Build Status](#build-status) for exactly what is and isn't implemented — nothing in this README describes code that doesn't exist.

Backend-only by design. The deliverable is the API: its schema, its authorization model, and its documentation.

## Tech Stack

| Concern | Choice |
|---|---|
| Runtime | Node.js + TypeScript (ESM, run via `tsx`) |
| Framework | Express 5 |
| Database | PostgreSQL |
| ORM / migrations | Drizzle ORM + drizzle-kit |
| Cache / session state | Redis |
| Validation | Zod |
| Auth | JWT access + refresh tokens in httpOnly cookies |
| Hashing | bcrypt |

Express 5 matters here: it forwards rejected promises from async handlers to the error middleware automatically, so route handlers can `throw` typed errors without a `try/catch` wrapper in every one.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- A running PostgreSQL instance
- A running Redis instance on `localhost:6379`

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pleasentpark123/taskmanagementtool.git
cd taskmanagementtool
npm install
```

Create a `.env` in the project root:

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/taskmanagement
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=development
JWT_SECRET=<a long random string>
REFRESH_SECRET=<a different long random string>
```

Apply the schema and start the server:

```bash
npm run db:migrate
npm run dev
```

The server refuses to boot if any environment variable is missing or malformed — the Zod schema in `src/config/env.ts` validates `process.env` and calls `process.exit(1)` with the field errors printed. Failing at startup beats failing on the first request that happens to need the missing value.

### Scripts

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Start with file watching |
| `npm start` | Start once |
| `npm run typecheck` | `tsc --noEmit` |
| `npm run db:generate` | Generate a migration from schema changes |
| `npm run db:migrate` | Apply pending migrations |

---

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|---|:---:|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | yes | — | Postgres connection string |
| `JWT_SECRET` | yes | — | Access token signing secret |
| `REFRESH_SECRET` | yes | — | Refresh token signing secret — must differ from `JWT_SECRET` |
| `PORT` | no | `3000` | HTTP port |
| `NODE_ENV` | no | `development` | `development` \| `test` \| `production` |

Two separate secrets, not one. If they were shared, an access token would be a structurally valid refresh token and vice versa — the signature alone would no longer tell the two apart.

## API Reference

Base path: `/auth`

Authentication is cookie-based. The browser sends `token` and `refreshToken` automatically; there is no `Authorization` header. Both cookies are `httpOnly` and `sameSite: strict`, and `secure` in production.

### `POST /auth/register`

Rate limited.

```json
{ "name": "Mohamed", "email": "m@example.com", "password": "at-least-8-chars" }
```

`201` on success. `409 CONFLICT` if the email is taken. `400 VALIDATION_FAILED` on schema failure.

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "User registered successfully!",
  "user": { "id": 1, "email": "m@example.com" }
}
```

### `POST /auth/login`

Rate limited. Sets the `token` and `refreshToken` cookies.

```json
{ "email": "m@example.com", "password": "at-least-8-chars" }
```

`200` on success, `401 UNAUTHORIZED` otherwise.

### `POST /auth/refresh`

Rate limited. Requires the `refreshToken` cookie; deliberately **not** behind the auth middleware, since the access token is expected to be expired by the time a client calls this. Issues a new access token and a new refresh token.

`401` if the cookie is missing, invalid, expired, replayed, or the session was revoked.

### `POST /auth/logout`

Requires authentication. Denylists the current access token for its remaining lifetime, deletes the refresh token family, and clears both cookies.

### `GET /auth/me`

Requires authentication. Returns the current user, or `401` if the token is valid but the user record no longer exists.

```json
{ "success": true, "user": { "id": 1, "name": "Mohamed", "email": "m@example.com" } }
```

---

## Authentication Design

The parts worth explaining in an interview.

### Tokens live in httpOnly cookies, not localStorage

JavaScript cannot read an `httpOnly` cookie, so an XSS payload cannot exfiltrate the session. `sameSite: strict` is what covers CSRF, since the cookie is now sent automatically and would otherwise ride along on cross-site requests.

The refresh cookie is scoped with `path: '/auth/refresh'`. It is therefore not attached to ordinary API calls — the long-lived credential is only on the wire for the one endpoint that consumes it. (Note that `clearCookie` on logout must repeat the same `path`, or it clears nothing.)

### Login does not leak which emails exist

If the API returned "user not found" and "wrong password" differently, it would be an account enumeration oracle. Both paths return the same `401` with the same message.

Message parity alone isn't enough, though — skipping the bcrypt compare when no user is found would make the "no such user" response measurably faster and leak the same information through timing. So the compare always runs, against a hardcoded dummy hash when there's no user or no stored password:

```ts
const passwordResult = await bcrypt.compare(password, user?.hashedpassword ?? DUMMY_HASH)
if (!user || !passwordResult) throw new UnauthorizedError("Invalid email or password.")
```

### Refresh token rotation with reuse detection

Every refresh issues a new refresh token and invalidates the old one. A session is a *family*, keyed by a `sid` claim carried in both tokens, with the currently valid JTI stored in Redis at `family:{sid}`.

On refresh, the presented JTI is compared against the stored one:

- **Match** — rotate: generate a new JTI, overwrite the key, issue new tokens.
- **Missing key** — the session expired or was logged out. `401`.
- **Mismatch** — a token that was already spent has been presented again. That means it was captured, because a legitimate client discards the old token the moment it receives a new one. The server can't distinguish the thief from the victim, so it deletes the entire family and forces both to re-authenticate.

The rotation write uses `KEEPTTL`:

```ts
await redisClient.set(`family:${sid}`, newJti, { KEEPTTL: true })
```

Preserving the original 30-day expiry is the whole point. Writing a fresh `EX` on every refresh would let an active session extend itself indefinitely, and a stolen token inside an active session would never expire.

The mismatch check is ordered after the missing-key check on purpose — `null !== jti` is also true, so checking mismatch first would report "revoked" for sessions that had merely expired.

### Logout revokes an already-signed token

A JWT is valid until it expires; the server can't unsign one. To make logout immediate, the access token's JTI is written to `denylist:{jti}` with a TTL equal to its *remaining* lifetime, and the auth middleware checks that key on every request. The TTL means Redis evicts the entry exactly when the token would have expired anyway, so the denylist stays bounded rather than growing forever.

The denylist check fails **open** — if Redis is unreachable the request is logged and allowed through. That's a deliberate availability-over-security tradeoff for a supporting check: the alternative is that a Redis outage locks out every authenticated user. The signature check, which is the actual security boundary, never depends on Redis.

### A valid signature is not a valid payload

`jwt.verify` proves the token was signed by us. It proves nothing about the shape of what's inside. The middleware validates the payload independently before trusting it — that `sub` is a positive integer, and that `jti`, `exp`, and `sid` are present and of the right type — rather than assuming a well-formed claim set.

### Registration handles the concurrent-signup race

The route checks for an existing email before inserting, but that check is not the thing that guarantees uniqueness. Two simultaneous requests can both pass it. The unique index on `users.email` is the real constraint, so the insert catches Postgres error `23505` and converts it to the same `409` the pre-check would have produced.

## Data Model

Currently migrated:

```
users ──< memberships >── organizations
                               │
                               ├──< teams ──< projects
                               │
                               └──< activity_logs >── users
```

| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `users` | Account, unique email, bcrypt hash |
| `organizations` | Tenant root, unique slug |
| `memberships` | Join table carrying the user's role in an organization |
| `teams` | Scoped to an organization, unique name per org |
| `projects` | Scoped to a team, unique name per team, status enum |
| `activity_logs` | Append-only event record |

### Decisions

**Role lives on the membership, not the user.** `memberships.user_role` is what makes a person an Owner in one organization and a Guest in another. Putting the role on `users` would have made it global and forced a rewrite the moment a user joined a second org.

```sql
UNIQUE (user_id, organization_id)
```

That constraint is what prevents a user from holding two conflicting roles in the same organization.

**Cascades are chosen per relationship.** Deleting an organization cascades to its memberships and activity logs, since neither means anything without it. Enum-backed columns (`user_role`, `project_status`) keep invalid states out of the database rather than relying on application code to be careful.

**`activity_logs` is append-only** and uses a polymorphic `(entity_type, entity_id)` pair so any future entity can be logged without a new column — indexed as a composite, since the pair is only ever queried together.

**Uniqueness is scoped, not global.** `UNIQUE (team_id, name)` on projects means two teams can each have a "Website" project, which is what you want in a multi-tenant system.

---

## Error Handling

Every operational error is a typed class extending `AppError`, carrying an HTTP status and a stable machine-readable code:

| Class | Status | Code |
|---|---|---|
| `ValidationError` | 400 | `VALIDATION_FAILED` |
| `UnauthorizedError` | 401 | `UNAUTHORIZED` |
| `ForbiddenError` | 403 | `FORBIDDEN` |
| `NotFoundError` | 404 | `NOT_FOUND` |
| `ConflictError` | 409 | `CONFLICT` |
| `TooManyRequestsError` | 429 | `RATE_LIMITED` |
| `InternalError` | 500 | `INTERNAL_ERROR` |

A single error middleware is the only place that writes an error response:

```json
{ "success": false, "code": "CONFLICT", "message": "A user with this email already exists!" }
```

The distinction the handler is built around: **an `AppError` is an error we threw on purpose; anything else is a bug.** Typed errors return their own message. Everything else is logged in full and returned as a generic `500` that says nothing — stack traces and internal messages never cross the wire in production. The underlying message is appended as `debug` only when `NODE_ENV !== 'production'`.

It also handles the cases Express raises before any route runs — `entity.parse.failed` for malformed JSON, `entity.too.large` for oversized bodies — and bails out via `next(err)` if headers were already sent, since at that point only Express can safely tear down the response.

---

## Rate Limiting

Fixed-window counter in Redis, keyed by IP, applied to the auth routes:

```ts
const currentRequests = await redisClient.incr(key)
if (currentRequests === 1) await redisClient.expire(key, 60)
```

`INCR` on a missing key creates it at 1, which is the signal to set the window's TTL. When the limit trips, `TooManyRequestsError` carries the key's remaining TTL, and the error middleware surfaces it as a `Retry-After` header so clients know exactly when to retry instead of hammering blindly.

Like the denylist, this **fails open** — a Redis outage should not take authentication offline.

---

## Project Structure

```
index.ts               # boot: connect Redis, listen, crash handlers
drizzle/               # generated migrations
src
├── app.ts             # express wiring, middleware order
├── redis.ts           # shared redis client
├── config/            # zod-validated env
├── db/                # drizzle client, schema, relations
├── lib/               # AppError hierarchy
├── middleware/        # auth, rate limiter, error handler
├── routes/            # route handlers
├── validation/        # zod request schemas
└── types/             # express request augmentation
```

Middleware order in `app.ts` is load-bearing: `notFoundHandler` sits after all routes so it only runs when nothing matched, and `errorHandler` is mounted last because Express only recognizes error middleware that is both four-arity and registered after everything it protects.

`index.ts` connects to Redis *before* binding the port, so the process never accepts traffic it can't serve. `unhandledRejection` and `uncaughtException` both log and exit rather than continuing — a process in an unknown state should be replaced by the supervisor, not kept alive.

---

## Known Limitations

Being explicit about what would need to change before this ran in production:

- **Rate limiting is per-IP and fixed-window.** Users behind a shared NAT share a bucket, and the window boundary allows a burst of up to 2× the limit across two adjacent windows. A sliding window or token bucket keyed per user would be the fix. The `INCR`/`EXPIRE` pair is also two round trips — if the process dies between them the key never expires. A Lua script or `SET NX` would make it atomic.
- **The current limit is 5 requests/minute**, which is a development value, not a production one.
- **The Redis client uses default connection settings** rather than a configurable URL, so it only talks to `localhost:6379`.
- **Route handlers query the database directly.** As the domain logic grows past authentication, this needs the service/repository split so that permission checks live in one enforceable layer.
- **`users.hashedpassword` is nullable**, which anticipates OAuth accounts but currently just means the login path has to defend against it.
- **No tests yet.** `vitest` and `supertest` are installed; the auth flows — particularly refresh reuse detection — are the first things that need coverage.
